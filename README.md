# Beyond-Grief: A Case-Study

## Abstract
Children are unquestionably precious, deserving of unwavering commitment to their vigilant protection. This sentiment can hold especially true for parents and grandparents who have lost children due to illness. Looking for answers to their unbearable and tragic loss can lead some to conclude that vaccinations may be responsible for the development of disease and the ultimate passing of the child. In these situations, parents/grandparents may likely become hesitant toward vaccines and actively choose not to attain vaccinations for subsequent children. Vaccine hesitancy poses significant public health challenges, influencing vaccination rates and potentially contributing to preventable disease outbreaks. To gain comprehensive insights into their experiences, beliefs, and decision-making processes concerning their aversion to vaccinations, this qualitative study aimed to investigate vaccine hesitancy among parents/grandparents who have tragically lost a child to illness and hold the viewpoint that vaccinations may have played a significant role in the untimely passing of their child. A case study approach directed the data collection process, which included in-depth interviews with a parent and grandparent who have experienced the loss of a child and exhibit vaccine hesitancy. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling. Narrative analysis was employed to identify structure, content, themes, and storytelling elements.
